This is a basic Jekyll theme built solely for aesthetic purposes and to replicate the NieR: Automata in-game menu.

It is currently a work-in-progress project.

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is a static site generator built with the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language. It is especially useful for creating static blogs or featuring products.

## Features

There are no special features, this is just a fun project to replicate the NieR: Automata in-game menu on large screens. We're working on a mobile-friendly layout, but since the original game is meant for desktops, wide screens are the main focus.

There are certainly better and more accurate ways to replicate the main menu. Additional Gems or CSS / JS libraries could potentially be added in updates for more advanced features and more game-accurate animations.

## Installation

Once the planned updates have been implemented, a detailed guide will be written.

## Inaccuracies

There are some key inaccuracies with this theme regarding the actual in-game menu. The following is a non-exhaustive list of inaccuracies.

- Lack of icons in the horizontal top menu items
- Lack of arrow pointer on hover / selection of horizontal menu items
- Lack of style change to horizontal menu items when said menu item is selected
- Lack of left-to-right background colour change animation for column menus
- Lack of left-to-right typewriter effect for column menus
- Lack of arrow pointer on hover / selection of column menu items

Some of these may be fixed in the future.

## Updates

The following updates will eventually be implemented:

- Add pagination to ```blog``` route
- Fix system layout
- Add map / image layout
- Add a second post layout ( or layout similar to one of the numerous in-game layouts)
- Move code into correct files (currently it follows no stardard rules between layouts, includes, and .html templates.)
- Modify and reduce CSS based on best practices (removing nested styles)

There are no plans to update this beyond the listed improvements.
